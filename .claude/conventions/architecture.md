# Architecture

**MVVM + Repository pattern, dependency injection via initializers — no singletons of our own.**

- ViewModels use the **`@Observable` macro** (Swift Observation, iOS 17+), not the older
  `ObservableObject`/`@Published` pair — plain `var` properties, no `@Published`. Views hold them
  with `@State private var viewModel = SomeViewModel()`, not `@StateObject`. Deployment target is
  iOS 18.1 so this is available everywhere; don't reach for `ObservableObject` out of habit.
- Views/ViewModels are organized **by feature, not by layer** — e.g. `Manik/Manik/Auth/` holds
  `AuthView.swift` and `AuthViewModel.swift` together, rather than spreading them across generic
  top-level `Views/`/`ViewModels` folders. A model only lives inside a feature folder if it's
  genuinely private to that feature; anything referenced from more than one feature belongs in
  `Manik/Manik/Models/` instead — that's where `Service` and `Block` live, since each is read
  by more than one feature (`Service` by Мої послуги and the Schedule's slot popup; `Block` by the
  Schedule and Статистика), not just by the screen that created it — and `UserProfile`, the
  account model `Root/` reads. `Models/` is the **domain
  layer** — the M of MVVM — not "files that contain a struct": it also holds derived properties of
  domain types (`Block/Block+Minutes.swift`, `Block/Block+StartDate.swift`) and domain
  configuration with no fields at all (`WorkHours.swift`). **A domain rule that two features must
  agree on lives here too, even when it is one line.** `Block/Block+Completed.swift`
  (`isCompleted(now:)` — `confirmed` and already ended) is read by both the master's
  `StatsCalculator` and the client's `AccountStats` (the client cabinet, removed in M-30 — the
  extraction rule stands); it started as a private helper inside the
  former and was extracted the moment the latter needed the same answer. Two copies that happen to
  agree today is not the same thing as one predicate that cannot disagree — and the design doc for
  the second consumer had in fact already drifted to a different definition before the extraction
  caught it. The rule for extensions is **an extension
  of our type lives beside the type; an extension of a foreign type lives where it's used** — which
  is why `View+Shadow.swift` and `Extension+ElmsSans.swift` sit in `Assets/UICommons/` next to the
  components that consume them, and not in some `Extensions/` folder. A folder grouping files by
  the `extension` keyword would organize by language construct, exactly the layer-first mistake this
  section rejects. A type gets its own subfolder (`Models/Block/`) once it spans more than one file;
  single-file types stay flat. **A type that exists only to serve one neighbour lives in that
  neighbour's file, not in its own** — `BlockActionConfirmation` sits with `BlockAction`,
  `StatsRoute` with `StatsLinkRow`, `MonthlyTotals` with `StatsCalculator`. Order inside such a file
  is supporting type first, the file's namesake second. This is not a licence to pile unrelated
  types together: the test is whether the type would ever be referenced without its host, and a
  three-line enum that only feeds one `navigationDestination` would not. A feature also owns
  **presentation models** — `MonthlyStats`, `ScheduledBlock` — built from a persistence
  model and never written back. They carry ready-made
  display strings so views never touch `DateFormat` or a raw stored value, and they keep persistence
  fields the screen has no business with (`status`, `clientId`) out of reach of the view.
  **The arithmetic that feeds a presentation model does not format it.** A pure calculator
  (`StatsCalculator`) returns numbers — `MonthlyTotals` is `Int`s — and the presentation model's
  `init(totals:)` does every `ServiceFormat.price`, `.formatted()` and percent string. Mixing the
  two has a concrete cost, not just a stylistic one: with no test target the only way to check a
  figure is a temporary text `#Preview`, and comparing *formatted* output makes that check depend on
  the device locale. Rules about what to *show* (hide the comparison when the previous month was
  zero) belong on the presentation side too — that is a display decision, not a sum. The same
  principle applies
  to reusable *views*: a component used (or reusable) across more than one feature lives in
  `Manik/Manik/Assets/UICommons/` (e.g. `WeekDayStrip`, `DashedSlot`, `View+BrandShadow`, the
  `ElmsSans` font extension), not in a feature folder, and must not depend on any feature's types
  (e.g. a feature's `*Metrics`) — give it its own private constants or take them as parameters.
  Those constants are a `private enum Layout` **nested inside the component's struct** — the
  pattern of every non-generic component there (`CapsuleButton`, `WeekDayStrip`,
  `LargeTitleHeader`, …). It moves to file scope as `private enum <Name>Layout` only when nesting
  is impossible: a generic type (below) or a bare `View` extension with no struct to nest in
  (`View+InputField`). `PopupContainerLayout` is file-scope *and* internal because callers reuse
  its `fade`.
  **When several cards repeat themselves, extract the chrome, not the card.** Cards that differ in
  structure — centred vs leading, a row with a chevron, one of them a `NavigationLink` — stay
  separate views; folding them into one configurable card trades short honest files for a chain of
  `if`s behind a growing set of flags. What is genuinely shared is the surface: padding, fill,
  corner radius, shadow. That lives in `.cardSurface(fill:padding:cornerRadius:fillsHeight:)`, and
  the repeated glyph tile in `IconBadge` (wine glyph on `WineSoft`; see the wine accent in
  `code-style.md`). Note `fillsHeight`: the frame that equalizes heights in
  a `GridRow` must sit *between* the padding and the background, which a caller cannot reproduce
  from outside, so the modifier branches internally instead of exposing the order.
  A feature folder holds only that feature's View, view model, feature-private model, subviews, and
  a feature-local metrics file (e.g. `Schedule/ScheduleMetrics.swift`, `Stats/StatsMetrics.swift`).
  A metrics file holds **layout** numbers only — anything the view model needs to reason about
  (salon working hours, tolerances, durations) is domain config and lives in `Models/`
  (e.g. `Models/WorkHours.swift`), otherwise the view model ends up importing the view layer.
  A generic UICommons component (e.g. `SwipeToDelete<Content>`) must keep its constants enum at
  **file scope**, not nested inside the struct — Swift forbids static stored properties in types
  nested within generic types, and moving them "tidily" inside breaks the build.
- Screen-covering popups are presented by the feature that owns them, via `.fullScreenCover` +
  `.presentationBackground(.clear)` — **not** by hoisting state into `MasterRootView`
  so a shared `ZStack` can draw them above the tab bar. Presentation modifiers
  render outside the view hierarchy, so the tab bar stops being a reason to leak feature types into
  the router. To keep a custom fade instead of the system slide-up, wrap the *state mutation* in a
  `Transaction` with `disablesAnimations = true` and animate inside the popup; never put
  `.transaction { }` on the modifier, which disables animations for the whole subtree.
- **The routers are a system `TabView`** (`Tab(_:systemImage:value:)` over `MasterTab`),
  which renders Liquid Glass on iOS 26 and the standard bar on 18 from the same code, with no
  `#available`. It owns the bottom safe area, including inside a screen's own `NavigationStack`, so
  screens take no clearance parameter. The inset stops scroll content *at* the bar's top edge, not
  above it, so every scrolling tab screen ends its content with its own bottom padding from its
  metrics file (`contentBottomPadding`/`listBottomPadding`, 24pt) — without it the last row sits
  flush against the glass (found on a device: the old client Account screen's "Видалити акаунт"). Two consequences of
  the system bar: **tabs keep their state across switches**, so a flow that hands off to another tab
  must reset its own navigation path first (the client booking flow, removed in M-30, cleared its
  `path` in `finishBooking()` before switching to "Мої записи"); and **a tab's `.task`s run
  only while it is on screen** — they don't start for a tab never opened and are cancelled when the
  user switches away — so a subscription that feeds a tab badge starts in the router, not in the
  tab's screen (the Requests badge did this until the tab was removed in M-30). The selected-tab colour is `.tint(Color.ink)` on the `TabView`,
  with each tab's content re-tinted `.tint(Color.accentColor)` so it doesn't leak into carets and
  pickers (see "Accent and tab bar" in `code-style.md`).
- **Nested `NavigationLink`s don't work.** Wrapping a whole card in a link and then putting a link
  inside it is unpredictable in SwiftUI — the inner one may never receive taps, or both fire. If a
  card needs more than one destination, don't wrap the card: give each control its own link
  (the client `ServiceOfferCard`, removed in M-30, did this — each hour chip pushed that slot, the
  round chevron pushed the whole offer). Accept that the card body then stops being tappable, and give any icon-only control
  an `accessibilityLabel`, since it is otherwise silent to VoiceOver.
- **Input masking uses `.onChange`, never `Binding(get:set:)`.** The obvious way to cap or reformat
  what a `TextField` accepts — a computed binding whose `set` filters the incoming string — **does
  not work**: when the filtered result equals the value the property already held, nothing
  observable changed, so the field keeps the text the user typed and the rejected character stays on
  screen. Bind straight to the view model property and normalize in `.onChange`, where the corrected
  value genuinely differs from the typed one and the field updates (the client `ProfileFormPopup`,
  removed in M-30, masked the phone this way; M-32's client form is the next one). The consequence is that the view model stores the **display** text and derives
  the clean value from it, not the reverse. Don't reach for a `didSet` on the property either:
  property observers under `@Observable` are a macro-expansion question not worth answering when
  the state can be computed instead (e.g. `showsPhoneError = hasSubmitted && isPhoneValid == false`).
  The same goes for **splitting one value across several controls** (hour and minute wheels for a
  time): don't derive the parts with `Binding(get:set:)`. Model the value as a small struct whose
  parts are stored properties and bind each control by key path — `TimeWheel` binds
  `$time.hour`/`$time.minute` on `ClockTime`. A rule tying the parts together (hour 22 → minute
  `00`) is a `didSet` on that plain struct, which is fine: the `@Observable` caution above is about
  observers on view model properties, not on a value type stored in one.
- **A `Task {}` created inside a `View`'s helper method does not inherit `MainActor`.** `Task`
  captures isolation *statically*, from the enclosing declaration — and helper methods on a `View`
  struct are nonisolated (only `body` carries the protocol's `@MainActor`). So anything
  **synchronous** called after an `await` — a `dismiss()` closure, an `onSuccess()` callback —
  runs on the generic executor and mutates `@State` off the main thread. Nothing diagnoses this:
  the callee is nonisolated too, so even Swift 6 stays quiet. Write `Task { @MainActor in ... }`
  at these sites (`ServiceFormPopup`, `AddNewSlotBlock`, `BlockActionButton` all do). Don't
  annotate the *method* instead — that cascades up through every caller (`actions(dismiss:)` and
  friends) and then into closure-conversion questions. A `Task {}` whose only post-`await` work is
  another `await` needs nothing: the async call hops to its own actor by itself.
  `Service`/`Block` use `@DocumentID var id: String?` (Firestore assigns it, don't encode it
  yourself). `UserProfile.id` is `uid`, since that collection is keyed by the Firebase Auth uid
  rather than an auto-generated document ID.
- `Manik/Manik/Services/Repositories/` — protocols only (`AuthRepository`, `ServiceRepository`,
  `BlockRepository`, `UserDataRepository`). These files must **not** import Firebase — that's the whole point: ViewModels
  depend on these contracts, not on Firestore/Auth directly, so a fake implementation can stand in
  for SwiftUI previews or tests without touching the network.
- `Manik/Manik/Services/Firestore/` — concrete implementations (`FirebaseAuthRepository`,
  `FirestoreServiceRepository`, `FirestoreBlockRepository`, `FirestoreUserDataRepository`). `Firestore.firestore()`/`Auth.auth()`
  are singletons managed by the Firebase SDK itself; that's fine and expected — what we avoid is
  wrapping *our own* repository classes in `.shared` singletons. ViewModels take a repository
  protocol as an init parameter, defaulting to the real Firestore-backed implementation.
  Every master's data lives under her own `users/{uid}/`; the Firestore repositories reach it
  through `Firestore.userCollection(_:)` (`Firestore+UserCollection.swift`), never a hard-coded
  top-level `collection(...)`, so protocols and view models never see the uid.
- **App-wide settings get a top-level feature folder**, like `Auth/` and
  `Root/`: `Appearance/` holds `AppAppearance` (System / Light / Dark, stored in
  `@AppStorage("appearance")` and applied by `RootView`) and `AppearancePicker`, the rows shown in
  the Profile screen (`Master/Profile/`). It has no view model — the picker only reads and writes
  `@AppStorage`. `LargeTitleHeader` takes an optional trailing view: Статистика puts the round
  person button there, which opens Profile.
- Two `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`s feed the `Manik` target: `Manik/Manik/` (app source) and
  `Manik/Assets/` (build resources that aren't Swift source living next to feature code — currently
  just `Manik/Assets/Font/`). Both are auto-picked-up like the `GoogleService-Info.plist` case (see
  `firebase.md`); dropping a file into either tree is enough, no manual "Add Files" step.
