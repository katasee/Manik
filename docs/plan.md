# Manik — Implementation Plan

Living checklist of implementation progress and next steps. Update this file whenever a step is
finished or the plan changes — this is what lets work continue from any machine/terminal. Full
product scope/design decisions live in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-manik-mvp-design.md`;
this file is just "what's done, what's next," not a design doc.

## Done

- **PR1 — data layer**: `Models/` (`UserProfile`, `Service`, `Block`), `Services/Repositories/`
  (protocols) + `Services/Firestore/` (implementations), `firestore.rules` (format validation,
  privilege-escalation protection, client-booking field pinning). Firebase SDK as remote SPM
  dependency.
- **PR2 — Auth**: `Auth/AuthView.swift` + `AuthViewModel.swift`, email/password sign in/sign up.
  Design system: custom `ElmsSans` font (`Assets/Font/` + `Assets/UICommons/Extension+ElmsSans.swift`),
  color palette in `Assets.xcassets` (`Background`, `Ink`, `TextSecondary`, `Surface`,
  `FieldBackground`, `Badge`), shared `View+BrandShadow`. `AuthView` split into
  `AuthFieldView`/`ModeSwitcher`/`AuthFocusField`/`AuthMetrics`.
- **PR3 — root routing (in progress, branch `feature/pr3/root-routing`)**: `Root/RootView.swift` +
  `RootViewModel.swift` — checks auth state + role (`fetchProfile()`), routes to
  `Master/MasterRootView.swift` / `Client/ClientRootView.swift` (currently placeholder screens:
  cabinet title + name + sign out). `ManikApp` now starts from `RootView()`.
- **PR4 — custom tab bar (branch `feature/pr-4-custom-tabbar`)**: `TabBar/` (`CustomTabBar` +
  `CabinetKind`, `TabBarButton`, `TabBarActiveIndicator`, `TabBarBadge`, `TabBarMetrics`),
  `Master/MasterTab.swift`, `Client/ClientTab.swift`. Floating dark-capsule tab bar (fixed 70pt
  height, visible captions under each icon) wired into `MasterRootView` (3 tabs) and
  `ClientRootView` (3 tabs — added "Акаунт"/`.account`, currently an `EmptyView()` placeholder).
  Colors consolidated: `TextPrimary` renamed to `Ink` (general dark UI token, not just text), the
  two dedicated `TabBarBackground`/`TabBarActiveBackground` colors were dropped in favor of
  reusing `Ink`/`Background`. Badge parameter exists but is stubbed to `nil` until the Requests
  screen ships (tracked as a Next step above).
- **PR5 — Master Schedule shell (branch `feature/pr-5-scheduleView`)**: view-only Schedule screen —
  `Master/Schedule/` (`ScheduleView` with title + week strip + hourly timeline, `@State selectedDate`,
  no view model; `HourlyTimelineView` = hour label per row with a `DashedSlot` in the gap;
  `ScheduleMetrics`). Reusable components pulled into `Assets/UICommons/`: `WeekDayStrip` (week-day
  date picker) and `DashedSlot` (tappable dashed-outline labeled slot), both decoupled from feature
  metrics. `DateFormat` split into storage formatters (`date`/`time`, pinned `en_US_POSIX` for
  Firestore) and display formatters (`dayNumber`/`weekdayLetter`/`monthYear`, `Locale.current` so the
  UI is multilingual). Tab bar scroll-clearance fixed: content reserves space via a `Color.clear`
  `safeAreaInset` (`TabBarMetrics.reservedClearance`) while the bar stays a `ZStack` overlay so its
  switch animation stays smooth. Block-rendering work (`ScheduleBlockCard`, `ScheduleBlockDetailSheet`,
  `ScheduleViewModel`, `UserRepository`/`FirestoreUserRepository`, `SchedulePreviewData`) was built
  then **git-stashed** for the follow-up slices below (still sitting in `git stash list`, untouched
  by PR7 — see PR7 note on why).
- **PR7 — Master Schedule: create free-time slot (branch `feature/pr-7-createFreeSlot`)**: tapping
  `DashedSlot`'s "+ Додати вільний час" on any hour row opens `Master/Schedule/CreateBlock/
  AddNewSlotBlock.swift` — a custom centered popup. Backdrop is a dimming `Rectangle().opacity(0.5)`,
  tapping it dismisses the popup (an accessible `Button`, not `onTapGesture`); the card carries
  `.brandShadow()` (needs `.compositingGroup()` first, otherwise SwiftUI shadows every child
  individually instead of the card's outline). PR7 presented it as a `ZStack` overlay owned by
  `MasterRootView`, because that was the only shared `ZStack` spanning both the schedule content and
  the floating `CustomTabBar`; **PR8 replaced that with `.fullScreenCover` owned by `ScheduleView`**
  — see the PR8 entry. Fields: "Дата" is a native `DatePicker(.date)`; "Початок"/"Кінець" are plain
  `TextField`s for manual `HH:mm` entry (parsed/validated in `CreateBlockViewModel`'s
  `startTimeText`/`endTimeText`, `didSet`-driven) — not a wheel picker, since a UIKit-wrapped
  `UIDatePicker` (tried first, for `minuteInterval` snapping) and a plain `DatePicker` wheel were
  both dropped in favor of typing the time directly. Default duration when opening the popup is 1
  hour (`ScheduleMetrics.CreatePopup.defaultDurationMinutes = 60`). Services render as a checklist
  (`ServicesChecklist`, checkmark-circle icons) reading whatever's in the `services` Firestore
  collection — no CRUD screen yet (still step 2 below), so services are hand-seeded via Firebase
  Console for now. A `#if DEBUG` override feeds a `FakeServiceRepository`/`SchedulePreviewData`
  instead of live Firestore — kept deliberately so the checklist has something to show before real
  services are seeded; **it lives in `ScheduleView.serviceRepository` since PR8** (was
  `MasterRootView`). Remove it once Firestore `services` has real data or step 2's CRUD screen
  exists. New files live under `Master/Schedule/CreateBlock/` (`AddNewSlotBlock`,
  `CreateBlockContext`, `CreateBlockViewModel`, `ServicesChecklist`) and `Services/Fakes/`
  (`FakeBlockRepository`, `FakeServiceRepository`) — split out from a flatter `Master/Schedule/`
  once it hit 11 files.
- **PR8 — Master Schedule: render + delete blocks (branch `feature/pr-8-showBlocks`)**: blocks from
  Firestore now appear on the timeline, which became a **proportional** grid — `Timeline/` holds
  `TimelineGeometry` (pure `CoreGraphics` math: `offset(forHour:)`, `offset(for:)`, `height(for:)`
  against a fixed `Size.hourHeight = 84`), plus `TimelineHourGrid`, `TimelineFreeSlots`,
  `TimelineBlockCards` and the card itself; `HourlyTimelineView` is now just their composition.
  A card's *frame* is exactly its duration — visual breathing room comes from
  `Card.verticalInset` applied **before** `.frame(height:)`, so insetting never distorts the time
  axis. Hour labels are nudged up by `Size.hourLabelCentering` so the glyphs sit centered on their
  line rather than hanging below it (without this everything positioned mathematically *looks*
  short). Overlapping blocks cascade Google-Calendar style: `ScheduledBlock.depth` = how many
  earlier blocks it overlaps, driving both a leading indent and `zIndex`. Swipe-to-delete via a new
  `Assets/UICommons/SwipeToDelete.swift` (generic container — its `Layout` constants must stay at
  file scope, Swift forbids static stored properties in types nested inside generics) backed by a
  new `BlockRepository.deleteBlock(blockId:)`; `firestore.rules` already allowed `delete` for the
  master. Only one row opens at a time (`openBlockId` lives in `HourlyTimelineView`), and tapping
  anywhere in the timeline closes it. `ScheduleViewModel` owns all derived state — it exposes
  `scheduledBlocks: [ScheduledBlock]` and `freeHours: Set<Int>`, rebuilt from `didSet` on
  `blocks`/`selectedDate`/services rather than recomputed in `body`. **Salon working hours and the
  free-slot tolerance moved out of `ScheduleMetrics` into `Models/SalonHours.swift`** — they are
  domain config, not layout, and the view model can't depend on view-layer metrics. An hour keeps
  showing "+ Додати вільний час" while at most `SalonHours.freeSlotToleranceMinutes` (20) of it is
  occupied. `DateFormat` gained `hourLabel(for:)`/`displayTime(_:)` (template `"jmm"`, not `"j"` —
  the latter drops minutes) so times follow the device locale instead of a hardcoded `HH:mm`.
  The create-slot popup moved from a `MasterRootView` `ZStack` overlay to `.fullScreenCover` +
  `.presentationBackground(.clear)` owned by `ScheduleView`; its system slide-up is suppressed with
  a `disablesAnimations` `Transaction` at the mutation site (**not** `.transaction` on the modifier,
  which would kill animations across the whole subtree) while `AddNewSlotBlock` fades itself in/out
  via `@State isVisible` and `withAnimation(_:completion:)`. `MasterRootView` is now a pure router:
  no view model, no popup state, no feature types.

## Next steps (in order)

1. **Master — Schedule: block detail + "Заявки" (Requests)** — PR8 renders and deletes blocks but a
   card is not tappable: no detail view, and `pending` blocks can't be confirmed/declined yet. The
   stash still holds a built `BlockDetailPopup`/`BlockDetailViewModel`/`UserRepository` +
   `BlockStatusPill` for this (see Housekeeping). Requests = list of `pending` blocks with
   confirm/decline, sharing the same detail surface.
2. **Master — "Статистика" (Stats)**: month summary (revenue/visits/cancellations) + entry point to
   "Мої послуги" (services CRUD). Once this exists, remove the `#if DEBUG` fake-services override
   in `ScheduleView` and seed real services through the CRUD screen instead of Firebase Console.
3. **Client — "Запис" (Booking)** (mockup screen 03): month calendar → time chips → service picker
   → footer bar with "Продовжити".
4. **Client — "Мої записи" (My bookings)**: list of own pending/confirmed blocks, cancel action.
5. **Client — "Акаунт" (Account)**: currently an `EmptyView()` placeholder behind the 3rd client
   tab (`ClientTab.account`) — needs real content (profile info, sign out moved here from the
   temporary root placeholder, etc.).
6. **"Забули пароль?"**: decide tappable-stub vs. real `sendPasswordReset` flow, then implement.
   (Was tracked as a task in a now-disconnected MCP tool — re-track here instead.)
7. **Confirm `firestore.rules` deployment**: verify the latest rules (format validation +
   privilege-escalation + booking field-pinning) are actually published in Firebase Console — this
   has been mentioned multiple times but never confirmed done.
8. **Live badge counter on "Заявки"**: `CustomTabBar`'s badge parameter currently always returns
   `nil` (`Master/MasterRootView.swift`, `CabinetKind.master`'s `badge` closure). Once the
   "Заявки" screen (step 1 above) exists, wire this to a live count of `pending`-status blocks
   from `BlockRepository`, likely via an `AsyncStream` observation similar to `observeBlocks()`.

9. **Accessibility debt (found in PR8 review, deliberately not fixed there)**:
   - `Font.elmsSans(_:_:)` calls `Font.custom(_:size:)` **without `relativeTo:`**, so Dynamic Type
     is effectively off app-wide. Adding it is one line, but the schedule also needs `@ScaledMetric`
     for `Size.hourHeight` or larger text will overflow the cards.
   - A block's status is conveyed *only* by the accent-capsule color (`statusPending` vs
     `statusConfirmed`) — nothing for `\.accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor`, and VoiceOver
     never reads the status. Needs a second signal (icon/pattern) plus an accessibility label.
   - `SwipeToDelete`'s trash button has no text label (removed on request), so VoiceOver announces
     the raw SF Symbol name.
10. **Slot creation can overlap an existing block**: since PR8 an hour still offers
    "+ Додати вільний час" while ≤20 min of it is taken, but `CreateBlockContext` carries only
    `startHour` (no minutes), so the popup opens at the top of the hour and can produce an
    overlapping block. Teaching the context minutes touches `AddNewSlotBlock` +
    `CreateBlockViewModel`. Deleting a `confirmed` block also has no confirmation step.
11. **Swift 6 language mode**: the project builds in Swift 5 mode with `minimal` concurrency
    checking. Several `View` initializers construct `@MainActor` view models from a nonisolated
    context (`ScheduleView`, `AddNewSlotBlock`) — legal today, an error under Swift 6 until `View`
    conformance carries main-actor isolation. Don't paper over it with per-`init` `@MainActor`.

## Housekeeping

- Commit + push `feature/pr3/root-routing`, open PR, once the tab bar + first cabinet screen make
  it a coherent reviewable chunk (or sooner, at your discretion).
- **Two stashes are outstanding** (`git stash list`):
  - `stash@{0}` — the full first cut of PR8 (proportional timeline, block detail popup + delete,
    `UserRepository`, popup scaffold components, 13 localization keys). PR8 shipped a much smaller
    slice re-implemented from a clean tree, so popping this **will** conflict across
    `ScheduleView`/`ScheduleViewModel`/`HourlyTimelineView`/`MasterRootView`/`ScheduleMetrics`.
    Cherry-pick the detail-popup files for step 1 rather than popping wholesale.
  - `stash@{1}` — the older PR5 stash (it shifted down from `stash@{0}` when the PR8 stash was
    pushed). Largely superseded by PR8; review, then drop.
